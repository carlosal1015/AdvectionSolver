# AdvectionSolver
This code solves the 1D advection equation using a finite volume approach. It uses different numerical methods to approximate the flux between cells. It is meant as a showcase of the methods involved and should not be seen as a ready-to-use code for numerical simulation of physical systems described via the 1D adv. eq.
